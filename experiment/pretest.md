### Q3. Incremental fuel cost is defined as:

a) Ratio of fuel input to generator output  
b) Derivative of generator's cost function with respect to its power output  
c) Difference between maximum and minimum cost  
d) Ratio of cost to load demand  

### Q4. Which of the following methods can be used for solving economic dispatch problems?

b) They must generate equal power  
c) The cheaper generator will supply full load  
d) The generator with lower penalty factor will supply more
